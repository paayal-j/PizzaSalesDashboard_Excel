# NOTE
If you want to apply the Month, Quarter, Week filters to the above queries you can use WHERE clause. Follow some of below examples
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date)

*Here MONTH(order_date) = 1 indicates that the output is for the month of January. MONTH(order_date) = 4 indicates output for Month of April.

SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date) = 1
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date)
